1. Number Classification:
- Checks if the number is 1 or 0.
- Determines if the number is a prime or composite number.
2. Prime Number Check:
- Divides the number by all possible divisors up to the number itself.
- Counts the number of divisors.
- If the count is 2, the number is prime.
3. Composite Number Check:
- If the number is not prime, it's considered composite.
4. Palindrome Check:
- Reverses the digits of the number.
- Compares the reversed number with the original to determine if it's a palindrome.
5. Repunit Check:
- Checks if the number is a repunit (consisting entirely of ones).
- Specifically checks for 1 and 11.
6. Message Display:
- Displays appropriate messages based on the classification of the number:
- Prime number.
- Composite number.
- Palindrome number.
- Not a palindrome number.
- Repunit.
- Not a repunit.



Prime/Deficient/Abundant Test
1. Zero Check:
- Checks if the input number is zero.
- Displays a message indicating it's zero.
2. Divisor Calculation:
- Calculates the sum of divisors for the input number.
- Checks if the number is divisible by all numbers from 1 to itself.
3. Number Classification:
- Classifies the number based on the sum of its divisors compared to itself:
- Perfect number: Sum of divisors equals the number.
- Deficient number: Sum of divisors is less than the number.
- Abundant number: Sum of divisors is greater than the number.
4. Message Display:
- Displays appropriate messages based on the classification of the number:
- Perfect number.
- Deficient number.
- Abundant number.
- Zero.
5. Program Termination:
- Exits the program after displaying the appropriate message
